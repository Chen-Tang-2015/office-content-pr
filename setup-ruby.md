The purpose of this guide is to walk through the process of creating a simple Ruby on Rails app that accesses a user's data in Office 365. The source code in this repository is what you should end up with if you follow the steps outlined here.

## Before you begin ##

This guide assumes:

- That you already have Ruby on Rails installed and working on your development machine. 
- That you have an Office 365 tenant, with access to an administrator account in that tenant.
