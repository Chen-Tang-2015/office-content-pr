# Get setup

If you haven't already, let's get setup:

1. Get [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
2. [Get an Office 365 for business account](#bk_Office365Account), to access the Office 365 APIs.
3. Install and setup [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) dependency manager by running the following commands:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
```

If the install and setup were successful, you should see the message **Setup completed** in Terminal.

**Note**: These commands only needs to be run once.


4. If you'd like, download the [Office 365 SDK for iOS](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-365-SDK-for-iOS), otherwise, we'll take care of this in a bit.
