Unlike other versions of Office Apps that support VBA, Office 2016 for Mac Apps (specifically Mac Word, Mac Excel and Mac PowerPoint) are sandboxed.
Sandboxing resctricts the Apps from accessing resources outside the App container and hence any add-ins or macros that involve file access and/or inter-process communication are affected.
We have built solutions from that will allow you minimize the effects of Sandbox among other things.
Also, there are a few other small and big differences between how VBA/VBE compare against Windows Office and Mac Office 2011.
We plan to use this space to document as much as we can to help you modify your solutions to fit Office 2016 for Mac and make them cross-platform.
