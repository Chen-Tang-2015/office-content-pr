# Microsoft Graph Beta API Reference

This is a preview set of APIs that we've made publicly available to developers to provide an early look at what we're building, and to gather feedback about the features and how they work.   

These APIs are subject to change prior to finalization, possibly even changes that would break code written using them. Because of this, features and APIs marked as preview in the Microsoft Graph should not be used in production code.
