# Application resource type

Represents an application. Any application that outsources authentication to Azure AD must be registered in a directory. This involves telling Azure AD about your application, including the URL where it's located, the URL to send replies after authentication, the URI to identify your application, and more.  For more information, see [Basics of Registering an Application in Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-authentication-scenarios/#basics-of-registering-an-application-in-azure-ad). Inherits from [DirectoryObject].

### Properties
| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|appId|String|The unique identifier for the application.|
|appRoles|[AppRole](approle.md) collection|The collection of application roles that an application may declare. These roles can be assigned to users, groups or service principals.                              **Notes**: Requires version 1.5, not nullable.|
|availableToOtherTenants|Boolean|                **true** if the application is shared with other tenants; otherwise, **false**.|
|deletionTimestamp|DateTimeOffset|The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 would look like this: `'2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'`|
|displayName|String|The display name for the application.|
|errorUrl|String|                              |
|groupMembershipClaims|String|A bitmask that configures the "groups" claim issued in a user or OAuth 2.0 access token that the application expects. The bitmask values are: 0: None, 1: Security groups and Azure AD roles, 2: Reserved, and 4: Reserved. Setting the bitmask to 7 will get all of the security groups, distribution groups, and Azure AD directory roles that the signed-in user is a member of.                              **Notes**: Requires version 1.5.|
|homepage|String|The URL to the application├óΓé¼Γäós homepage.|
|identifierUris|String collection|The URIs that identify the application. For more information see, [Application Objects and Service Principal Objects](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-application-objects/).                              **Notes:** not nullable, the **any** operator is required for filter expressions on multi-valued properties; for more information, see [Supported Queries, Filters, and Paging Options](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn727074.aspx).|
|keyCredentials|[KeyCredential](keycredential.md) collection|The collection of key credentials associated with the application                              **Notes:** not nullable|
|knownClientApplications|Guid collection|Client applications that are tied to this resource application. Consent to any of the known client applications will result in implicit consent to the resource application through a combined consent dialog (showing the OAuth permission scopes required by the client and the resource).                              **Notes**: Requires version 1.5, not nullable.|
|logoutUrl|String|                              |
|mainLogo|Stream|The main logo for the application.                              **Notes:** not nullable|
|oauth2AllowImplicitFlow|Boolean|Specifies whether this web application can request OAuth2.0 implicit flow tokens. The default is **false**.                              **Notes**: Requires version 1.5, not nullable.|
|oauth2AllowUrlPathMatching|Boolean|Specifies whether, as part of OAuth 2.0 token requests, Azure AD will allow path matching of the redirect URI against the application's **replyUrls**. The default is **false**.                              **Notes**: Requires version 1.5, not nullable.|
|oauth2Permissions|[OAuth2Permission](oauth2permission.md) collection|The collection of OAuth 2.0 permission scopes that the web API (resource) application exposes to client applications. These permission scopes may be granted to client applications during consent.                              **Notes**: Requires version 1.5, not nullable.|
|oauth2RequirePostResponse|Boolean||
|objectId|String|The unique identifier for the application. Inherited from [DirectoryObject].                              **Notes: **                **key**, immutable, not nullable, unique Read-only.|
|objectType|String|A string that identifies the object type. For applications the value is always "Application". Inherited from [DirectoryObject].|
|passwordCredentials|[PasswordCredential](passwordcredential.md) collection|The collection of password credentials associated with the application.                              **Notes:** not nullable|
