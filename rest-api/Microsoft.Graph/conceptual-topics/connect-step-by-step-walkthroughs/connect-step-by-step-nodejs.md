# Call the Microsoft Graph API with a Node.js app

In this article we look at the minimum tasks required to connect your application to Office 365 and call the Microsoft Graph API. We use code from the [Office 365 Node.js Connect sample using Microsoft Graph](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-Nodejs-Unified-API-Connect) to explain the main concepts that you have to implement in your app.

## Prerequisites

This topic assumes a familiarity with the following:

* JavaScript
