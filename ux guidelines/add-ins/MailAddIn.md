###Functions with infobar notifications

In addition to displaying custom HTML UI using one of the layouts above, mail add-ins have the ability to execute functions from commands. Whenever you need to display UI as a result of a function developers have the ability to display info bar notifications. A common use of infobar notifications is to display errors or success messages.
