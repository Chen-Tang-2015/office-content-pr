# Add-in UX Guidelines #

##Basics
###Designing an Office Add-In
Add-Ins primary purpose is to extend the Office experience to provide contextual functionality that helps users get more done more without leaving the Office clients. By avoiding costly context switches Add-Ins empower users to be more productive by using Office tools along with 3rd party functionality. 

Add-In UX must be designed to integrate with Office, providing the most efficient, natural interaction possible. Add-Ins should take advantage of Office UI extensions (commands) to provide access to add-in functionality and use the recommended patterns and building blocks when creating custom HTML-based UI. 

The following sections contain the principles that all Office Add-Ins should follow as well as recommended patterns that fit most interaction models. The building blocks section contains specific UI elements that will quickly help you build your user interface. 
 
###Core principles
- **Explicitly designed for Office**. The functionality, look and feel of an Add-In must harmoniously complement the Office experience, including participating on the Office or document theme.
 
- **Make users more efficient**. An Add-In helps users get one job done while not getting in the way of other jobs. Users can interact back and forth between their documents and an Add-in without disrupting their flow. 

- **Favor content over chrome**. An Add-In content and functionality are emphasized over any accessory chrome. Maximize the use of real state by avoiding superfluous UI elements that don't add value to the user experience.  

- **Keep users in control**. Users are situated at all times, feel in control of their experience, understand any important decisions and can easily reverse action the Add-In performed. 

- **Cross-Platform**. An Add-in must be designed to work on all the platforms that Office supports. While the Add-In platform itself provides the inherent capability of Add-Ins to run across all Office clients, the UX of the Add-In must be optimized to work across platforms and form factors. Both mouse/keyboard and touch input devices must be supported. For any custom HTML UI, the UI must be responsive to adapt to different form factors. The "touch" section provides specific tips to optimize your add-in to use in touch devices.  

###Branding
We welcome and celebrate Add-Ins that adequately use branding to inspire trust and situate users. We discourage abuse of branding to overwhelm or advertise to users. Depending of the type of Add-in that you are creating we recommend specific places to showcase your branding (see recommended layouts)

###Design language
We recommend Add-In developers to adopt the Office design language and use our UI toolkit to create custom HTML based experiences. If your company already has a design language or specific design elements that you want to use in an Add-In you are welcome to do so as long as the end result provide a harmonious experience for customers.
