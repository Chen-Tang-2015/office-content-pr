# Add-in UX Guidelines #


##Basics
###Designing an Office Add-In
Office Add-Ins primary purpose is to extend the Office experience to provide contextual functionality that helps users get more done more without leaving the familiar Office experience. By avoiding costly context switches Add-Ins empower users to be more productive by using the tools they already use and love. 

Add-In UX must be designed to integrate with Office, providing the most efficient, natural interaction possible. Add-Ins should take advantage of Office UI extensions (commands) to provide access to add-in functionality and use the recommended patterns and building block when creating custom HTML-based UI. 

The following sections contain the principles that all Office Add-Ins should follow as well as recommended patterns that fit most interaction models. The building blocks section contains specific UI elements that will quickly help you build your user interface. 
 
###Core principles
- **Explicitly Designed for Office**. The Add-In was explicitly designed to work with Office (e.g. it is not a web page crammed into an IFrame). The look and feel of the Add-In harmoniously complements the Office experience, including participating on the Office or document theming. 
 
- **Efficient**. Users can interact back and forth between their documents and your add-in without disrupting their flow. The Add-In helps users get one job done while not getting in the way of other jobs. 
- **Content over chrome**. The Add-In content and functionality are emphasized over any accessory chrome. Maximize the use of real state by avoiding superfluous UI elements that don't add value to the user experience.  

- **Keep users in control**. Users are situated at all times, feel in control of their experience, understand any important decisions and can easily reverse their actions. 

- **Multi-platform**. Add-Ins must be designed to run on all the platform that Office runs. Both mouse/keyboard and touch input devices must be supported. For any custom HTML UI, the UI must be responsive to adapt to different form factors.  

###Branding
We welcome and celebrate Add-Ins that adequately use branding to inspire trust and situate users. We discourage abuse of branding to overwhelm or advertise to users. Depending of the type of Add-in that you are creating we recommend specific places to showcase your branding (see recommended layouts)

###Design elements
While we strongly encourage you to adopt Office design elements, already embodied in the building blocks below, we welcome Add-Ins that use design elements from your company or from other companies to improve the user experience. For example, if there are already specific icons, actions, colors, fonts that users find familiar and helps them recognize and better interact with your add-in, its perfectly fine to use them in your Add-In. The end result must be cohesive, efficient and visually appealing to users.  

##Recommended layouts
Depending on the type of Add-In that you are building there is a basic UX layout that we recommend. We encourage you to use this layout as your starting point and enrich/adapt it to better fit your needs.
