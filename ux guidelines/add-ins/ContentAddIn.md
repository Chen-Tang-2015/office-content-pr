Create a consistent look and feel for your content add-ins by using the recommended design layout. The recommended layout for a content add-in includes the following elements: 

- Add-in content
- Command bar (optional) - Includes icons or navigation for users, and can overlay the add-in content. The maximum height is 80 pixels.
